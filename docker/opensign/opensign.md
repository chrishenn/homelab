# Opensign

Docuseal may be more amateurish and ugly, but it does appear to work, at a minimum.

Project looks great, like it may have been excellent at some point. I couldn't get email to send through my SMTP server,
and the configuration as consumed by the src does not remotely match what's documented. Then there's the source
itself ... this is not a well-maintained project.
