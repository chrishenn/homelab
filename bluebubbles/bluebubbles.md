DO not delete the vendor_macs.tsv file! I rescued that from the wayback machine. The generator scripts that run
in the official docker-osx project require those mac prefixes with vendors in this format, but the current online source
has been taken down. Copy this file into the folder where you're generating your serials

Remember to add the file "env" from op, with UUID and serials defined in it
