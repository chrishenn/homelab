failed services that I deleted

audacity web ui - unneeded
drawio - crappier excalidraw
guacamole - crappy nexterm/iterm
jitsi - just a big damn mess. not ported to docker well
13 foot ladder - nonworking when I tried it (medium nor nyt)
localai - janky and terrible.
nextcloud - just terribly slow. maybe my db config was the issue, but probs not worth it
pihole - using blocky and it's find
sist2 / elasticsearch - very heavy fuzzy search over files. not much use
webcord - unneeded
whisper - big mess. doesn't unload models reliably, which poses a danger of crashing your system
scriberr - has hardcoded dependencies on docker services having certain names, db users having certain names. Don't bother
squirrel - janky, unstable, hardcoded deps on docker svcs. don't bother
